Konak_Database_Application
==========================
This is a Database Application built as a project for Database Systems course (CS5200)
This is an application to help people search and book hotel rooms.
As per the Prof's requirement (of not storing static data) , we used JSON data from a WebService to provide us with the required useful hotel data
We had 2 views one for guest user and registered user. The users also had provision to leave back feedbacks about different hotels.
We used MySQl for the backend, front-end was developed using JSF(Java Server Faces) +HTML+ CSS. 
Java was used as the middle tier. We also implemented ORM for mapping entities to database.


We followed Waterfall model as the SDLC process. 
We started right from design phase of coming up with UML design documents followed by implemtation and testing.
